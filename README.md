## 4. JB Elias Pty Ltd, B Hillsdale Pty Ltd, Damjet Pty Ltd, Homebur Develop Pty Ltd, B-1sT Choice Roofing Pty Ltd

The strata plan lodged for the 1-5 Bourke Road, Mascot, property identifies five companies as the landowners or developers of the project.

Four of those companies have been deregistered. Yet many of the directors and shareholders of the five companies continue to be involved in a range of Sydney property projects.

The one company not to be deregistered, JB Elias Pty Ltd, is owned by Hanna and Susie Elias.

A separate company owned by 59-year-old Hanna Elias, JB Hillsdale Pty Ltd, obtained approval for a 69-unit project at Bunnerong Road, Hillsdale, in 2017, and won state government approval for extra apartments at that site last year.

Other projects developed by companies controlled by Mr Hanna Elias include a unit block on Robertson Street in Sutherland in 2011 and a townhouse development on Myrtle Street, Botany, the following year.

The 55-year-old Elias Elias of Strathfield was a director and shareholder of the deregistered Damjet Pty Ltd, one of the Mascot landowners. Another company owned by Elias Elias, Homebur Develop Pty Ltd, last year obtained approval from Sutherland Council for a 34-unit development in Gymea. A separate company owned by Elias Elias is also working on that project.

Another company owned by Elias Elias has developed townhouses in Strathfield.

Sarkis Elias was a director of B-1sT Choice Roofing Pty Ltd, another of the Mascot developers. In 2010 a company owned by Sarkis Elias purchased the former Botany RSL club on Botany Road from RSL NSW; four years later a separate company owned by Sarkis Elias obtained approval for 19 units to be developed on that site.
